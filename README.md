# Pico

> A tiny (pico)system intended to send e-mail messages from a remote client

Pico is intended to be used as a tool to send system routines messages (e-mail messages). For instance, it could be
used to send daily e-mail messages from Tripwire executions; or a snapshot from the system journal. It relies on AWS
SES service, so both SMTP user and password are necessary.
